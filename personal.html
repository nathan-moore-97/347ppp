                    Probably my biggest hobby. The world of computing is massive, and I enjoy <br>
                    applying the skills I have been taught in my classes to create small projects <br>
                    for myself and keep my skills sharp.

                    I played classical guitar for four years in high school. Once I got serious  <br>
                    about college many of my other hobbies at the time fell by the wayside as I <br>
                    dove into my studies. Recently, I have begun a personal journey to bring music <br>
                    back into my life.

                    This summer, I was privileged to join a team at JMU X-Labs preparing for the  <br>
                    upcoming inter-disciplinary Autonomous Vechicles course. During my time in  <br>
                    that position, I got the oppurtunity to learn a bit about hardware, sensors  <br>
                    and electronics. I'm excited to see where this new hobby will take me in the 
                    future.

                    Movies and television can be interesting and powerful art forms, but from a <br>
                    young age I have gravitated towards games of all kinds. I have many happy memories <br>
                    of laughing myself sore at a table with my family, or at my computer with my  <br>
                    friends. I try to view games as technical achievments, and think critically  <br>
                    of them as an art form. Recently in college I have been introduced to my  <br>
                    other major hobby, tabletop roleplaying games. Cheap, exciting, and with  <br>
                    infinite possibilities, I have grown very fond of these games and the shared  <br>
                    experiences they offer with friends.

                    Before joining James Madison University as a Computer Science student, my original <br>
                    plan was to transfer to Johnson and Wales as a student of Culinary Arts. Cooking is  <br>
                    one of the few hobbies that almost everyone can enjoy. It is easy to work with someone <br>
                    that doesnt share any other interests with you, good for family time, relaxing, and <br>
                    at the end of it all, you get to enjoy a delicious meal or pastry for your efforts,  <br>
                    and share your work with others.
