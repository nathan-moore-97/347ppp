            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello! I'm Nathan, 22 years old and a student at James Madison Univeristy in Virginia. 
            <br><br>
            I was never the best at academics in high school, and I found myself at the end of my senior  <br>
            year without a college, a plan, or much drive to make anything of myself. I began attending  <br>
            community college in Northern Virginia as a way to gain a path forward. But I found much more  <br>
            than that. I found a love of learning, a natural curiosity, and a desire to begin my academic  <br>
            journey in earnest as soon as I could.
            <br><br>
            I began at James Madison Univeristy a year and a half later, as a student of Computer Science.  <br>
            Since then, I have found an insatiable appetite for the world of computing, and recently,  <br>
            mathematics. I've learned things I never could have imagined on my first day in Harrisonburg,  <br>
            found new hobbies, and met many interesting and brilliant people. This is my final semester at <br>
            JMU, and while I will miss my school dearly, I cannot wait to see what the world has in store for  <br>
            me next. 
            <br><br>
            Go dukes!
            </p>
