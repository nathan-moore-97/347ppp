            <p class="content">
                Hello! I'm Nathan, 22 years old and a student at James Madison Univeristy in Virginia. 
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                I was never the best at academics in high school, and I found myself at the end of my senior
                year without a college, a plan, or much drive to make anything of myself. I began attending
                community college in Northern Virginia as a way to gain a path forward. But I found much more
                than that. I found a love of learning, a natural curiosity, and a desire to begin my academic
                journey in earnest as soon as I could.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                I began at James Madison Univeristy a year and a half later, as a student of Computer Science.  
                Since then, I have found an insatiable appetite for the world of computing, and recently,  
                mathematics. I've learned things I never could have imagined on my first day in Harrisonburg,  
                found new hobbies, and met many interesting and brilliant people. This is my final semester at 
                JMU, and while I will miss my school dearly, I cannot wait to see what the world has in store for  
                me next.
